			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>

				<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
				<li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
				<li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

				<h3>Steps</h3>
				<ol>
			
					<li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven)</li>
					<li>Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat into smaller crumbles as the meat cooks.</li>
					<li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once in a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
					<li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
					<li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot.</li>
					<li>Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper.</li>
					<li>Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook uncovered for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for seasoning suggestions).</li>
					<li>About 15 minutes before the spaghetti sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Then, cook the pasta according to the package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
					<li>Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta and leave for a minute so that it absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with grated parmesan cheese on top.</li>
